! There are now four MySQL plugins, two pairs of inbound and outbound. 
! They are labeled as inbound1, outbound1, inbound2 and outbound2, 
! with the labels after the plugin names in square brackets e.g. mysql[inbound1]
! One pair is required for each table used. At the time of writing two pairs are in use,
! and this number is assumed for the rest of the document
plugins: mysql[inbound1], mysql[outbound1], mysql[inbound2], mysql[outbound2]

! The aggregates, sql_table, sql_history, sql_history_roundoff and sql_refresh_time values have been set up, one for each plugin
! They are associated with the plugin using labels, in the same manner as they are used in the plugin declaration.
! E.g. aggregate[inbound1]:
aggregate[inbound1]: src_host, src_port, dst_host, dst_port, proto
aggregate[outbound1]: src_host, src_port, dst_host, dst_port, proto
aggregate[inbound2]: src_host, src_port, dst_host, dst_port, proto
aggregate[outbound2]: src_host, src_port, dst_host, dst_port, proto
! Just log not local traffic
! May need to change for local network

! dst_port INT(2) UNSIGNED NOT NULL, ip_proto CHAR(6) NOT NULL, packets INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, bytes BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
