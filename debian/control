Description: pmGraph is a software application for network monitoring to work with pmacct
        The purpose of pmGraph is to work with pmacct, a network monitoring and auditing tool pmacct runs on a firewall, router or bridge, or collects information from multiple routers, and stores the information in a database. The database permits powerful analysis, but is difficult to use. pmGraph helps by providing a simple graphical overview of the network data recorded by pmacct.
